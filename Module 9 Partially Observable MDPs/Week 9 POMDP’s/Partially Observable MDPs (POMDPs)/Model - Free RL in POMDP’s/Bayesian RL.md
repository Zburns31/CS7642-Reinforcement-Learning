# What is it?

- Bayesian inference is a statistical technique that allows us to update our beliefs about the world based on new evidence
    - In the context of reinforcement learning, Bayesian inference can be used to estimate the uncertainty associated with the agent's beliefs about the environment
- In Bayesian reinforcement learning, we use Bayesian inference to estimate the distribution over possible models of the environment, given the observed data (i.e., the agent's experience)
    - We then use these posterior distributions to make decisions that balance exploration and exploitation
- The main advantage of Bayesian reinforcement learning is that it allows the agent to explicitly model its uncertainty about the environment and update this uncertainty as it gathers more data
    - This can lead to more robust and adaptive behaviour in complex and uncertain environments
